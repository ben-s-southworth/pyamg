- Not doing for adaptive, because old adaptive code is questionable.

- Relaxation on targets
	+ Need to account for Schwarz - is this done on targets?
- Aggregation
	+ Done for classical aggregation
	+ Done for naive aggregation
	+ Started for lloyd, need to add to amg_core
- Smoothing P
	+ Done for Richardson 
	+ Done for Jacobi
